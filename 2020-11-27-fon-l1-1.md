## Introduction
This is a course by Dr. Supriyo Datta available at nanohub.org with videos on YouTube as well.
The first lecture is about the motivation of the course.

When this course was released, the smallest transistors were around 14nm. Today there are chips
with 7nm transistors in them. 3DICs are being developed. It is hard to predict where technology
is going to be. 

So the course attempts to discuss a few fundamental topics in nanoelectronics. These are well
established and experimentally verified. The main focus is on developing an intuition on how
electrons move in small devices.

As an aside, I will be using devices and transistors interchangeably.
In both cases, I am referring to an electronic component that has three terminals (G, S and D).
Based on the drain-source voltage, electrons flow across the channel between them. The channel
length is considered the size of the device. 

Most text books and courses move top-down. They start from big devices and theorise on how it can
be applied to small devices. Dr Datta starts bottom-up and after forming both a mathematical and
physical picture of how electrons flow in small devices, extends this theory to big devices.

### Small and Big Devices
While discussing devices in terms of small and big, the primary consideration is whether the
length of the devices is bigger than the mean free path or not. Mean free path is the distance
that an electron travels before it collides with another electron.

If the length of the device is lesser than this, then an electron can move from one contact to
the other through the channel without any collisions. This form of transport is called ballistic
transport.

On the other hand, if the length of the device is bigger than the mean free path, then it collides
with other electrons and moves from one contact to the other in a random walk. This is called
diffusive transport.

### Why do electrons move?
From the big picture, electrons move when there is an electric field. But then why don't all
electrons move from one contact to the other? This is explained as that only 'free' electrons
flow.

In the bottom-up explanation, electrons move to achieve equilibrium. The source contact And only the electrons
near the Fermi level move. When a voltage is applied to the drain, its electrochemical potential
shifts down by qV.
